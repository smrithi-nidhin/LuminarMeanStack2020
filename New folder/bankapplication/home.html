                <h4>BUILDING BLOCKS</h4>
                One of the earliest banks in South India, "South Indian Bank" came into being during the Swadeshi
                movement. The establishment of the bank was the fulfillment of the dreams of a group of enterprising men
                who joined together at Thrissur, a major town (now known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala), in the
                erstwhile State of Cochin to provide for the people a safe, efficient and service oriented repository of
                savings of the community on one hand and to free the business community from the clutches of greedy
                money lenders on the other by providing need based credit at reasonable rates of interest.

                Translating the vision of the founding fathers as its corporate mission, the bank has during its long
                sojourn been able to project itself as a vibrant, fast growing, service oriented and trend setting
                financial intermediary.
